# Image-Captioning-for-Visually-Blind


To make the living of visually impaired better, assistive
technology can be developed using the concept of Image
captioning.As these people have difficulties in understanding and
making sense of their surroundings, generating text
descriptions in natural language that describes the visual
content of the surroundings will be helpful for them to
provide better scene understanding. Visually impaired
people can take an image of their surroundings and get
back the description of what is present in the image.

Our dataset consists of 5000 images of 5 different
categories. Each category has 400 images with 3 captions
per image.
Our product is an android application that will make use
of the model we have trained using the dataset that we
have built. The text images that will be supported by our
application are mainly the books, newspaper and any
documents.
This application can be controlled by voice i.e., it
supports voice assistance as well. The user doesn't have
to manually click on the screen to capture the image and
also play or pause the text output given by the
application.
